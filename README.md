DevOps is a web application that allows students and tutors to collaborate. The main objective of the project is to provide a latform for students and tutor to interact virtually.
The students are given a page where they can view their results wand book an appointment to meet their tutors.
Tutors on the other end use the app to add, edit and delete results of students, courses that students are doing and view appointment requests from students. 
To get started with the project, you will be required to clone this repository. Clone it here
